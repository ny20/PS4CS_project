    "##### The goal of this project is to analyze the likelihood of NHL players drafted in the second round or higher making it to the NHL. Using a dataset of NHL draft picks from 1963-2022, I will categorize the data by type and level of measurement, clean and prepare the data using Python and Pandas, and conduct statistical analysis to determine the probability of success for each draft round. This project aims to provide insights into the success rates of NHL draft picks and inform future draft strategies for teams.\n"

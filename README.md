# PS4CS_project
##### The goal of this project is to analyze the average number of games a NHL player drafted has played based on the round he was drafted in. Using a dataset of NHL draft picks from 1963-2022, I will categorize the data by type and level of measurement, clean and prepare the data using Python and Pandas, and conduct statistical analysis to determine the probability of success for each draft round. This project aims to provide insights into the success rates of NHL draft picks and inform future draft strategies for teams.
